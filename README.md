## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **SQL:** Used for fetching and analyzing data from the database.
* **Power BI Desktop:** The core tool used for data visualization and report building.
* **Excel:** Used for initial data exploration and validation.
* **DAX Language:** Used for creating advanced measures and calculated columns.
* **DAX Studio:** Utilized for optimizing report performance and analyzing query metrics.
* **Project Charter:** Used for defining the scope, objectives, and deliverables.

## 🧠 Skills & Techniques Demoed

Through this project, I demonstrated proficiency in the full data analysis workflow:

### Data Modeling & ETL
* **Data Modeling:** Designed a robust Star Schema consisting of Fact and Dimension tables to ensure efficient query performance.
* **Power Query (ETL):** Cleaned and transformed raw data (handling nulls, data type conversions, and unpivoting) to prepare it for analysis.
* **Date Table:** Created a dynamic Date table using **M Language** to support Time Intelligence functions.

### Advanced DAX & Calculations
* Created complex **Calculated Columns** and **Measures** using DAX.
* Implemented **Dynamic Titles** based on applied slicers/filters.
* Used **KPI Indicators** to visually flag performance against targets.
* **Time Intelligence:** Calculated Year-over-Year (YoY), Year-to-Date (YTD), and Year-to-Go (YTG) metrics.

### Dashboard UI/UX Design
* **Page Navigation:** Designed an app-like navigation experience using buttons.
* **Bookmarks:** Implemented bookmarks to toggle between different visuals (e.g., switching between Table and Chart views).
* **Conditional Formatting:** Applied to tables and charts to highlight high/low performance instantly.
* **Data Validation:** Ensured accuracy by cross-referencing Power BI results with Excel data.
* **Publishing:** Configured the Personal Gateway for auto-refresh and published reports to Power BI Service.

## 💼 Business Domain Knowledge

Beyond technical skills, this project required a deep understanding of business metrics and P&L analysis:

* **Revenue Metrics:** Gross Price, Pre-invoice deductions, Post-Invoice deductions, Net Invoice Sale.
